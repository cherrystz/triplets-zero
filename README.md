# Triplets with Zero Sum

This project contains a function  `findTriplets`  that identifies triplets in an array whose elements sum up to zero. The solution ensures that there are no duplicate triplets in the output.

## Problem Statement

Given an array of integers  `nums`, find all unique triplets (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 0.

### Constraints

-   The input array  `nums`  may contain duplicate elements.
-   The solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.
-   The function should have a time complexity better than O(N^3), where N is the number of elements in the array  `nums`.

### Implementation Details

The function  `findTriplets`  is implemented in Swift and utilizes sorting and two-pointer technique to efficiently find the triplets with zero sum, while ensuring uniqueness of the triplets in the result set.
